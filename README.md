# URL-to-MP4-Extractor

Electron-based desktop application that wraps a CLI media extraction engine with a GUI, validation, and graceful failure handling.

Supports many common media sources, but correctly fails on unsupported or protected platforms without attempting bypasses. Not every website or stream can be extracted by design.
